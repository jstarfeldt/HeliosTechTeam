The solar bus stop project is the engineering team’s current project. We are working with University Transportation services and the Office of sustainability to create a proposal to install solar panels that will power real-time bus schedules and lighting. Our role in this project is to do a study of campus to determine which shelters will be able to provide enough power for this system and to determine if flexible solar panels are suitable for our project.  

The first step in our project was to go around and take pictures of all potential sites to determine if there were major obstructions in the south. This helps us eliminate shelters that are obviously not able to produce enough solar power. Next, we built out a model in a solar design software (System Advisor Model) that we can use at each of the bus shelter sites to estimate solar production throughout the year. This will greatly simplify the testing process, as we wouldn’t need to bring solar panels and a testing setup to each location. Finally, we will come up with a proposal that describes where the panels will be installed and if flexible panels are suitable for the job. `

As one of several initiatives to reduce its energy footprint and operate more sustainably, the University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum Visitor Center will get a major solar panel upgrade beginning this week. 

The new Visitor Center system will include an array of 66 photovoltaic modules that are projected to produce 32,300 kilowatt-hours in the first year of operation, with a planned operational life of 30 years. The solar energy system will cover about 8 percent of the Arboretum’s current energy needs, resulting in a projected $3,750 decrease in annual electricity cost.

A data collection system and online dashboard will allow Arboretum staff and visitors to explore real-time energy production information remotely and on a display screen in the Visitor Center.

When the Arboretum built the McKay Nature Awareness Center (now the Visitor Center east wing) in 1977, it included a solar thermal collector on the roof that captured heat from the sun and stored the energy in a rock bed in a basement room, to be used to supplement building heating. While the system represented leading technology at the time, it had long since become ineffective and was removed in 2019. A solar photovoltaic tile system, which began operating on Earth Day 2001, remains on the west wing of the Visitor Center.

The solar installation has benefited from the support of many project partners. SunPeak, a Madison-based solar photovoltaic developer, is installing the new system. A $25,000 donation from Friends of the Arboretum, a nonprofit support organization, allowed the Arboretum to initiate project planning and is helping pay labor and installation costs. Solar for Good, an initiative of RENEW Wisconsin, has provided the solar panels at no cost to the Arboretum. At the completion of the project, the Arboretum will apply for a rebate from Focus on Energy, a program that offers incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy.

The Green Fund, a UW–Madison Office of Sustainability program, contributed $20,000 and has been a key collaborator in the planning process. The Green Fund engages students in projects that improve the sustainability of campus facilities. Undergraduates from the student organizations HELIOS and Sierra Student Coalition have been involved in every stage of the process: reviewing project specifications, calculating the impacts of the upgrades, meeting with project partners, writing grant proposals, and crafting communications to reach campus and community audiences.

In tandem with the solar installation, the Arboretum is working with the Green Fund on another sustainability initiative: upgrading the Visitor Center to energy-efficient LED lighting. In a 2018 energy use assessment, Madison Gas and Electric identified the potential to conserve energy by updating lighting systems throughout the building. The Green Fund students applied for additional funding, and $30,000 will be contributed toward the retrofit process.

The solar electricity produced on the roof will cover a higher proportion of the building’s total energy needs after the lighting is upgraded and Visitor Center energy use decreases. Existing infrastructure upgrades, as well as staff education and engagement, will also contribute to lower energy use. Several air conditioning units were replaced with higher efficiency units in summer 2019.

Over several years, Arboretum staff have pursued Green Office Certification through the Office of Sustainability. For this certification process, student employees from the Office of Sustainability assessed office operations and provided practical recommendations for improvements in waste and recycling, energy and water savings, and sustainable purchasing. Staff implemented changes throughout offices and common spaces for a greener workplace and achieved the Gold and then Platinum levels.

As spring returns to campus, UW-Madison has another reason to look forward to sunny weather. Following a year of research, project development, partnership building, and coordination, the Gordon Dining & Event Center now features a solar array on its roof that is projected to produce 42,800 kWh of electricity a year, or the energy use of five typical Wisconsin homes.1 All electricity produced by the panels will directly power the building.

The solar array, which was constructed by Madison-based company SunPeak, will provide University Housing with approximately $1,340 net annual income from renewable electricity production, resulting in at least $35,600 net income over the 30-year life of the system.2 Thanks to an online dashboard, the public can view comparative metrics and data—such as barrels of oil saved, or equivalent miles driven in an electric car—to understand the environmental impact of the solar array in real time.

The project relied on collaboration throughout its development, from the earliest stages of research through physical installation and interconnection with Madison Gas and Electric. During the spring semester of 2018, a group of Office of Sustainability staff members and interns, as well as leaders of the student organization Helios and the ASM Sustainability Committee, took a three-month course called Photovoltaic (PV) Development for Institutions offered by the Midwest Renewable Energy Association (MREA). The Office of Sustainability and University Housing worked closely with Helios—which is a student organization that aims to promote renewable energy on campus—to determine the feasibility of installing solar on the Gordon roof.

Helios students Zach Galvin, Jessie Steckling, and Sahil Verma then applied for a Green Fund grant from the Office of Sustainability to fund the solar array. UW-Madison also received a rebate from Focus on Energy to support the project. “Zach, Sahil, and Jessie translated an idea into a reality through their hard work, persistence, skill, and ability to collaborate with staff from all across the university and beyond,” shared Ian Aley, Green Fund Program Manager. “I feel grateful to get to work with such amazing students!”

University Housing, already a sustainability leader on campus, saw an ideal opportunity to expand its green infrastructure. Mike Henry, Assistant Director of Residence Hall Facilities, provided guidance during the project development process. Sustainability Coordinator Breana Nehls facilitated conversations among the many project partners. Meanwhile, Mark Mueller, who is maintenance and grounds supervisor for Gordon Dining & Event Center, was instrumental in bringing the solar array to fruition. “I like challenges no matter how hard they can be,” he noted. Mueller championed student engagement throughout the process, pointing to the importance of involving a student team in a large-scale sustainability project. “What better experience could they get?” Mueller said. “We have a big impact with students due to the amount that stay and eat in our facilities, and it’s important that we lead by example.”

Facilities Planning & Management (FP&M) also played a key role in the installation of the solar array. David Darling, Associate Vice Chancellor for FP&M, reviewed and approved the project before turning over supervision to Stu Larose. Larose, who is a Project Manager at Facility Planning & Delivery, was a central figure in shepherding the project through university processes. “From my perspective, the most impressive aspect of this project has been the broad collaboration,” commented Missy Nergard, Director of Sustainability. “It is an example of what can happen when we leverage the passion and innovation of our students and the expertise and knowledge of our faculty, staff, and community.”

Helios saw the opportunity to showcase renewable electricity so that other students could understand its potential in their everyday lives. “I think the most impactful part of the project will be the educational aspect,” suggested Helios co-founder Zach Galvin. “A lot of students on campus think solar is a good idea, but far fewer think it’s actually practical. When students are looking at the panels—which will be visible from the finished Nick—or when they are looking at the solar dashboard, I think it will start to change people’s minds about solar.”

Helios continues to pursue opportunities to engage and educate fellow students about renewable energy. For instance, they produced a video that explains the difference between fixed and variable energy costs for UW-Madison—a key piece of information to understand the rate structure that governs the university’s contract with Madison Gas and Electric. In addition, Helios is working with University Housing to upgrade dining and residence halls to energy-efficient LED lighting.

In the meantime, the new solar array on the top of Gordon Dining & Event Center will continue its quiet and essential work: absorbing the sun’s rays and helping UW-Madison on its ongoing journey to a more sustainable campus.
